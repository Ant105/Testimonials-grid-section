        <blockquote class="card__review-text2 card__review-text2--purple50">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="card__review-text2 card__review-text2--grey400">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
    100% recommend! ”</blockquote>
